I have a shiny new MacBook (c/o [Kevin](https://twitter.com/connerk), nice to meet you, Mavericks). Ruby is installed, and so is [Atom](http://atom.io), which I'm getting to know as I write THIS VERY POST, and which even now is reminding me that I need to edit my .gitignore (silly swap file.)

I need notebook paper, because I'm [STARTING CLASS SOON](http://academy.smashingboxes.com/). On Monday, in fact! Tomorrow I'm going to have lunch and course prep with [Julia](https://twitter.com/juliaelman), [Jessica](https://twitter.com/JessicaMitsch), and Emily (no link yet).  

I'm basically beside myself with excitement.  :)  I get to spend 12 weeks learning about Rails and working on projects.  TWELVE WEEKS!  Remember how when you were in elementary school, the first day of summer vacation felt like forever?  It feels like forever.  

We're gonna have some great adventures this summer.
